# Background

Here, we briefly overview the main cryptographic primitives ZeroPool is built
with.

## zkSNARK

We use zkSNARKs to enable a smart contract verify conditions on secret
user-supplied data without seeing it.

[this](/docs/fawkes-crypto/background) but shorter

## Merkle Tree

Hashes, transactions, poseidon hash, verifying in zkSNARK

Merkle tree is a binary tree where leafs contain the hashes of some useful
payload data, and each non-leaf node contains the hash of its children's
values.
